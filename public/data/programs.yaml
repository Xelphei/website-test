        experiments:
          - title: Baking Soda Volcano
            description: A classic chemistry demonstration showing an acid-base reaction that produces carbon dioxide gas.
            grade: Grades K-5
            time: 15 minutes
            steps:
              - Build a small volcano shape using clay or paper mache around a plastic bottle
              - Add 2 tablespoons of baking soda to the bottle
              - Mix red food coloring with vinegar in a separate cup
              - Pour the vinegar mixture into the bottle and watch it erupt!
            teacherNotes: Prepare newspaper or a tray underneath to catch overflow. This is a great introduction to chemical reactions for younger students.
          - title: Static Electricity Butterfly
            description: Demonstrate static electricity by making tissue paper butterflies fly using a charged balloon.
            grade: Grades K-5
            time: 20 minutes
            steps:
              - Cut small butterfly shapes from tissue paper
              - Inflate a balloon and tie it off
              - Rub the balloon on your hair or a wool cloth for 15 seconds
              - Hold the balloon above the tissue paper butterflies and watch them jump up
            teacherNotes: Works best in low humidity. Have extra balloons on hand. Discuss electron transfer at an age-appropriate level.
          - title: Density Tower
            description: Layer different liquids to create a colorful density column, demonstrating that different substances have different densities.
            grade: Grades 3-8
            time: 30 minutes
            steps:
              - Gather honey, corn syrup, dish soap, water, vegetable oil, and rubbing alcohol
              - Carefully pour each liquid into a tall clear glass in order from heaviest to lightest
              - Observe how the liquids form distinct layers
              - Try dropping small objects (grape, cork, plastic bead) and predict which layer they will float on
            teacherNotes: Pour slowly along the side of the glass for best results. Have students predict the order before the demonstration. Connects well to physical science standards on properties of matter.
          - title: Circuit Building Basics
            description: Students build simple circuits with batteries, wires, and LEDs to understand electrical flow.
            grade: Grades 6-12
            time: 45 minutes
            steps:
              - Identify the components — battery, wires, LED, and switch
              - Connect the positive terminal of the battery to one leg of the LED using a wire
              - Connect the other leg of the LED back to the negative terminal
              - Add a switch in the circuit and test it
            teacherNotes: Use low-voltage batteries (3V coin cells) for safety. Provide circuit diagrams as reference. Have extra LEDs since they burn out if connected backwards.
